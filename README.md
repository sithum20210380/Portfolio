# Personal Developer Portfolio 🚀

[![Site preview](/public/readmeCover.gif)](https://sithum-raveesha.vercel.app/)

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). it not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance. View the [live site](https://sithum-raveesha.vercel.app/).

# Features 🎉

The whole [portfolio](https://sithum-raveesha.vercel.app/) is a React-based single page app built with Next.js in Typescript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ✍🏻

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images 🖼️

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames

# ✨ Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sithum20210380/Portfolio.git

# GITHUB_TOKEN is required for some parts
# See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

npm i
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# 🚚 Deployment
